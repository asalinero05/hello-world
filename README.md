This repository was made to practice the GitHub flow.
Hi my name is Agustin, I'm just starting to learn how to code, so far I'm finding it very entertaining, I'm an Atletico de Madrid fan, and this year the team is winning the champions league.
I also like to watch the NBA as well as skiing and fishing.
